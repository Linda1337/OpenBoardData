# OpenBoardData
Data for board repairs, including network volt, diode, and resistance measurements

![Initial work](https://github.com/inflex/OpenBoardData/blob/master/resources/ss1.png)

### Format of data
* Each board has its own data file containing the nets for the board
* Lines prefixed with a '#' character at the start are ignored
* The header of the data file should contain the following fields
	- ID ( Unique ID for the board. *No spaces*. this is used to prefix the data in the generated database )
	- BRAND ( Used for reference, not actively used currently )
	- TYPE ( Laptop, desktop, phone, etc, not actively used currently )
	- COMMENT ( General comment, useful for guiding other people adding data perhaps )
* Each net is defined as a single line, fields are SINGLE-SPACE separated except for the comment;
* Diode, Voltage and Resistance readings can be also declared as 'na' (Not-applicable) and 'ol' (Over-limit / open )
* Networks can be aliases by prefixing === in front of aliased network after new net name
* > 820-00165 PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG ===PPBUS_G3H
* Line format is as follows;
* > NET_NAME  DIODE_READING  VOLTAGE_READING  RESISTANCE_READING  COMMENT

820-00165 PP3V42_G3H na 3.42 na If voltage below 3.35 check U7090 and feedback resistors R7080/R7081.\nAlso check for short.
820-00165 PPBUS_G3H na 12.56 na If voltage below 12.45V check SMC
